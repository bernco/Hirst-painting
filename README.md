# Hirst-painting
Turtle and Turple manipulation
The colorgram package was used to read the colors in the 'image.jpg' which was the Damien Hirst sample to model using Python turtle graphics
Thirty colors were extracted and saved to a list. Out of the 30 colors, three were discarded because of the high R or G or B values close to 255
which were almost white.


The outcome of the modelling is shown here!
